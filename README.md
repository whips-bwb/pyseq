# pyseq
a python midi sequencer

notes & setup inside the project
local use only (not network)
use a local midi synth (like Qsynth on linux) to send & hear midi drums/instruments
use an external device like akai MPX8 for more sounds ... (or use SoundFonts ... )

this program is very simple and focuses on pattern modifications using rules to transform tracks

python only, 
mido module for midi messaging
that's all folks, enjoy !
