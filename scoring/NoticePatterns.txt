notice for patterns : 
- respect the format (headers + instrument's parts)
- resolution are 8 or 16 only 
- representation of steps/hits :
    x normal hit 
    X accented hit
    o alternate sound (openHH, Open triangle, ... )
    O alternate accented 
    - no hit (but must be present for counting) 

score symbols : 
- 'A1x2' means repeating the pattern 2 times 
- adding special patterns/modes :
    '00' is 'normal play' : play exactly what is in the score 
    '01' is 'constrained random' : play sometimes (according to tension factor ?) some displaced or removed elements
    '02' is 'full random' : based on signature, play what you want ...  
    '+X' is 'raise TF' : incrementing the Tension Factor (complex pattern evolving) by 0.X
    '-X' is 'lower TF' : decrementing the Tension Factor (simpler pattern evolving) by 0.x
a global Events dict is produced before launching to report events and their position (starting measure) 
Tension Factor is evolving between -1 and +1 (0 average)

New Approach for Rules
1️⃣ Adaptive Window Size (TF-Based)

The higher the tension factor, the larger the window for replacement (e.g., 1-note at 0.1, 4-note at 0.8).

This prevents tiny TF changes from having drastic effects while allowing bigger shifts to be noticeable.

2️⃣ Signature-Aware Adjustments

For 4/4, changes occur in 2, 4, or 8 note blocks (binary).

For 6/8 or triplets, modifications happen in 3 or 6 note groupings (ternary).

This keeps the groove intact.

3️⃣ Dynamic Replacement Rules

Rules vary depending on TF (not just static sets).

Lower TF: Small shifts (adding offbeats, mild variations).

Higher TF: More aggressive changes (doubling notes, denser grooves).

4️⃣ Instrument-Specific Nuances

BD (Kick): Keep solid pulse, add syncopation, ghost notes.

SD (Snare): Add backbeat emphasis, flams, ghost hits.

HH (HiHat): Open/close variations, subtle polyrhythms.

Cymbals: Enhance accents, spread variations naturally.
